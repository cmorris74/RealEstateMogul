DISCLAIMER:  This game was not developed by, licensed, or endorsed by Hasboro.

Charles Darrow's invention was not entirely original.  He adapted existing games to create the one which he manufactured and sold himself
during the early 1930s.  However, he is responsible for many of the details of the game that we know today.

Darrow registered a copyright labeled "Monopoly".  It is listed on page 785
of the Catalog of Copyright Entries Part 1 - Books, Group 2 (Pamphlets, Leaflets, Etc.), for the year 1933.
It is dated July 30, 1933.  See https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyri301libr/page/784/mode/2up?q=monopoly.
It's unclear exactly what this copyright covers, since the game is certainly not a pamphlet or leaflet.
The boards Darrow made included the wording "Copyright 1933, Chas. B. Darrow".

The game was sold to Parker Brothers.  Darrow received a patent for his "board game apparatus", as assignor to Parker Brothers.  It was filed Aug 31, 1935.
See https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e0/Monopoly_board_game_patent_%28US2026082%29.pdf.  That patent has now expired.

Parker Brothers obtained copyrights on booklets titled "Rules for the game of Monopoly" (Apr 17, May 31, and July 9 of 1935) and
"The game of Monopoly; brief idea of the game" (Nov 5, 1935).  See https://archive.org/details/catalogueofcopyr321libr/page/1428/mode/2up?q=monopoly, p351, p660, p753 and 1047.
The original copyright terms for these have also expired.  A copyright term during that time frame was 28 years, but it could be renewed.
The Copyright Term Extension Act of 1998, (the Sonny Bono Act), extends the term for works published before January 1, 1978
to 67 years, granting a total of 95 years for works which were renewed.  I found copyright extensions on the Parker Brothers booklets
(https://archive.org/details/catalogofcopyrig3161lib/page/1994/mode/2up?q=monopoly, p1995), but could not find one for the original
"Monopoly" copyright by Darrow.  Even if it was renewed, that copyright will expire soon on July 30, 2028.

The MONOPOLY name is trademarked, and trademarks last indefinitely.  A decision by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 1982 declared that "monopoly" was
a generic term, which effectively canceled the trademark (https://grr.com/publications/monopoly-trademark-hasbros-monopoly/).
The case was appealed to the Supreme Court in 1983, but they refused to hear the case.  However Public Law 98-620 passed in 1984 amends the Lanham Trademark Act so that
"A registered mark shall not be deemed to be the common descriptive name of goods or services solely because such
mark is also used as a name of or to identify a unique product or service."  That essentially reverses the 1982 case, and restores the MONOPOLY trademark.

The current owner of the MONOPOLY trademark is Hasboro.  The rulebook that came with my copy of the game claims:
"The PARKER BROTHERS, HASBORO, and MONOPOLY names and logos, the distinctive design of the game board, the four corner squares,
the MR. MONOPOLY name and character, and each of the distinctive elements of board and rules are trademarks of Hasbro
for its property trading game and game equipment. © 2004 Hasbro. All Rights Reserved."

The trademark names are clear enough, but what constitutes a distinctive element?  What are they claiming is unique about their four corner squares?

Ralph Anspach, the defendant in the 1982 case, concluded that the only rights that the company retained were to some of the artwork
(https://web.archive.org/web/20041025080832/http://www.washingtonfreepress.org/36/court.html).  This game does not use any of the artwork
by Darrow or any of the company successors that shaped the commercial board game, nor does it use the MONOPOLY trademark name which was subsequently restored.
